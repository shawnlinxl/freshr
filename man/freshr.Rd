\description{
Ever experienced a time when you pass an R script to your
colleague, and it does not work on their machine because you forgot to
add a library import that you did interactively? freshr is here to
help! By calling freshr::freshr() at the top of your every script, you
create a fresh environment for you to test reproducibility before you
send your script to someone else.
